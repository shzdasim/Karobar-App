# 💼 Karobar-App (کاروبار)

## 📖 Overview

**Karobar-App** is a complete business management, billing, and inventory solution designed to help everyday business owners run their shops and warehouses smoothly. Instead of juggling paper registers (Khata), loose receipts, and manual calculators, Karobar-App brings your daily billing, stock tracking, customer accounts, supplier bills, and cash counter into one easy-to-use place.

Whether you are serving a busy line of walk-in customers at the counter or fulfilling bulk orders for regular credit buyers, Karobar-App keeps your numbers accurate and gives you a clear picture of your daily sales, stock levels, expenses, and real profit.

### What Karobar-App Does for You
* **Fast Counter Billing (POS):** Create cash or credit bills in seconds using a barcode scanner or quick keyboard shortcuts, print thermal receipts or full-page A4 invoices, and put bills on hold when a customer needs more time so the next person in line doesn't have to wait.
* **Smart Stock & Expiry Tracking:** Always know exactly what is on your shelves. Track products by pack or individual unit, manage batch numbers and expiry dates so older stock sells first, and get warned before items run out or expire.
* **Digital Customer & Supplier Khata (Ledgers):** Say goodbye to forgotten dues. Automatically track who owes you money and what you owe your suppliers, accept partial or advance payments, and print clean account statements whenever needed.
* **Cash Counter & Shift Tracking:** Keep track of every rupee or dollar entering and leaving your cash drawer during a shift—from cash sales and customer recoveries to petty shop expenses—and easily match your physical cash at closing time.
* **Clear Expenses & Profit Reports:** Record daily shop expenses like rent, electricity, salaries, and tea/refreshments, and instantly see your true net profit without complicated accounting math.

### Who Can Use Karobar-App?
Karobar-App is built to fit both **Retail** (selling single units to walk-in customers) and **Wholesale** (selling in packs and cartons with bulk discounts and credit terms), making it ideal for:

* **Pharmacies & Medical Stores:** Track medicine batches, expiry dates, strip/pack vs. tablet sales, and doctor/patient details for prescription items.
* **Wholesale & Distribution Businesses:** Manage bulk orders, bonus/free schemes, customer-specific pricing, and ongoing credit accounts.
* **Grocery Stores, Supermarkets & Karyana Stores:** Speed up checkout lines with barcode scanning, quick change calculation, and thermal receipt printing.
* **General Merchants, Hardware, Cosmetics & Auto Parts Shops:** Manage thousands of items, supplier purchases, returns, and customer balances effortlessly.
* **Traders & Multi-Counter Shops:** Give staff their own logins with controlled permissions so cashiers, storekeepers, and managers only see and do what their role allows.

![Dashboard](screenshots/Dashboard.png)

### 📦 2. Management
The **Management** section holds all your master records—products, barcode labels, categories, brands, suppliers, and customers.

#### 2.1 Products
* **Complete Product Setup:** Add products with item name, generic/formula name, product code, barcode, category, brand, preferred supplier, rack/shelf location, and product image.
* **Pack & Unit Pricing:** Define **Pack Size** (e.g., 1 box = 10 strips or 30 tablets), **Pack Purchase Price**, **Pack Sale Price**, **Unit Purchase Price**, **Unit Sale Price**, and **Wholesale / Discount Rules**.
* **Stock & Narcotics Controls:** Set minimum stock alert levels (`reorder level`) and mark restricted/prescription medicines (`Narcotic / Prescription Required`) so the POS automatically asks for Doctor and Patient details during billing.

![Products](screenshots/Products.png)

#### 2.2 Barcode Studio
A built-in label designer and barcode printing studio so you can tag products that arrive without manufacturer barcodes or print custom price stickers for your shelves.

* **Print Queue & Batch Selection:** Add one or multiple products to the print queue, pick specific batch numbers, and set exact label quantities per item.
* **Custom Label Designer:** Toggle what appears on the sticker—**Store Name**, **Product Name** (1 or 2 lines), **Product Code**, **Sale Price (MRP)**, **Batch Number**, **Manufacturing/Expiry Date**, and **Code-128 Barcode**.
* **Thermal Roll & A4 Sheet Layouts:** Supports single/double-column thermal sticker rolls (e.g., 50x25mm, 38x25mm) as well as multi-column A4 sticker sheets with customizable margins, gaps, and saved templates.

Built specifically for pharmacies, grocery stores, and perishable goods businesses where batch tracking and shelf-life control protect your profit.

#### 3.1 Expiry & Tracking

* **Filter by Supplier or Brand:** Quickly pull up all expiring items from a specific distributor so you can hand them back to the supplier's order booker before their return window closes.
* **One-Click Actions:** Directly initiate a **Purchase Return** to the supplier or move expired stock to **Quarantine & Disposal** right from the expiry screen.

![Expiry & Tracking](screenshots/ExpiryTracking.png)

#### 3.2 Quarantine & Disposal
When stock is expired, broken, spoiled, or recalled and cannot be returned to a supplier, **Quarantine & Disposal** ensures it is removed from saleable stock cleanly and recorded as an audited business write-off.

* **Quarantine Holding Bay:** Move questionable or expired batches out of POS saleable stock into quarantine so cashiers cannot accidentally sell them.
* **Cause & Disposal Method Tracking:** Log the exact reason (*Shelf Expiry, Physical Breakage, Cold-Chain Spoilage, Defective Return, Manufacturer Recall, Pest/Water Damage*) and disposal method (*Incineration, Chemical Neutralization, Municipal Waste, Handed to Supplier*).

![Purchase Invoice](screenshots/PurchaseInvoice.png)

#### 4.2 Sale Invoice (Retail & Wholesale Modes)
Depending on your store configuration, Sale Invoices support two tailored modes:
* **Retail Sale Invoice:** Built for selling individual units or packs to walk-in or credit customers, complete with batch selection (FEFO—First Expiring, First Out), instant stock checks, item/invoice discounts, and doctor/patient fields for restricted items.
* **Wholesale Sale Invoice:** Built for distributors and wholesale counters—supports pack/carton quantities, loose units, bonus/free schemes, bulk discounts, previous customer balance visibility on the bill, and A4 invoice printing.
* **Hold & Resume Drafts (`Alt+H` / `Alt+D`):** Put an unfinished bill on hold if a customer steps away, serve other customers, and resume the held draft anytime with live stock re-verification.
* **Smart Overpayment Handling:** If a credit customer pays more than the current bill total, the extra amount is automatically credited to their **Customer Ledger** to reduce their previous dues.

![Sale Invoice](screenshots/SaleInvoice.png)

#### 4.3 ⚡ Barcode POS (Fast Checkout Terminal)
A dedicated, full-screen, distraction-free counter terminal built for high-speed barcode scanning and keyboard-only operation.

* **Scan & Go Checkout:** Scan product barcodes continuously—each scan adds or increments the item immediately with audio feedback.

![User Demands](screenshots/UserDemands.png)

#### 6.3 Stock Adjustments

A structured multi-step workflow for conducting full-store or shelf-by-shelf physical stock counts:
1. **Start Session:** Create a stocktake session for the whole store, a specific category, or a specific brand.
2. **Physical Counting:** Staff enter the actual physical quantities counted on the shelves (`In Progress`).
3. **Variance Review (`Pending Review`):** Managers review a side-by-side comparison of **System Expected Stock** vs. **Physical Counted Stock**, highlighting shortages and overages with their exact financial value.
4. **Finalize & Sync (`Finalized`):** With one click, approve the session to automatically update all batch quantities to match the real physical count.
